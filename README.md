# Network-Traffic-Analysis

## Objective

Capturing and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark

### Skills Learned
- How to capture network traffic and analyize network traffic.
- Technque how to filter traffic using protocol, ports, or IP address.
- How to follow TCP and UDP Stream to see an entire conversation.
- How to create custom filters.

### Tools Used
- Kali Linux with Wireshark.

## Steps
Step 1: Launch Wireshark on my Kali Linux.

Step 6: Filter traffic use display filters to focus on specific traffic types.

Step 7: Right-click on a packet and select "Follow" where we can follow TCP or UDP stream to see the entire conversation.

Step 8: For advanced analysis Wireshark includes several built-in tools located in the Statistics Menu tools like: 
- Protocol Hierarchy: to view a breakdown of protocols used in the capture.
- Conversations: to see communication pairs and their traffic statistics.
- Endpoints: to view traffic statistics for individual endpoint (IP addresses).

Step 9: Create custom filters:

In conclusion we use Wireshark to captured network traffic and performed a basic analysis of my network.
